# Procedural terrain generation in p5

So here I am again, tinking around with procedural generation. The recent interest started from another [TheCodingTrain](http://thecodingtrain.com/) video from Daniel Shiffman, specifically around using perlin noise to create this essence of flying over a landscape. Following his youtube video, I got a decent first pass.

You can probably notice that the shading isn't all that good. And it also seems to run in strips along the mesh. This turned out to be related to the fact I was using a TRIANGLE_STRIP shape in order to squeeze some efficienvy out of the fairly crude surface I was drawing. 

Not satisfied I took to google where naturally Stack Overflow had the answer, with a kind [Spongman](https://github.com/Spongman) posting his example of a hacked version of p5.js on a [issues thread](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/2609) for processing.

You interact with this object in a way more akin to dealing with DirectX or OpenGL, wherein you must instruct it to compute the normals etc, but needless, it seriously ups the triangle count effortlessy to somewhere around 10k. Another bonus is the fact that point lights work great, and the example above has a sun and moon rising and setting around the scene. Neat!

I took this example, and had a play, which was great fun. My favourite outcome was a low flying view through a sort of valley. I acheived this merely by altering the camera's location, and applying a factor based on the x position of the nodes.

This got me thining. I'd seen a cool archipalgo example from a map maker on the reddit proc gen forums [WhereDragonsAbide] and how by applying a radial function, you could drop the perlin noise off and create cool islands!

I first knocked up a small 1D example in which I worked out how to create sliders etc with the p5.dom.js library, such that I could alter the variables live and configure the noise to the right specification.

I took this and applied it in a 2D sense, such that you could make top down maps. It wasn't much more complex to add a colouring the pixels based on height, such that I could mimic sea, sand, grass and snow!

A bit more hacking different bits together, and I smushed all the sliders from the applet into the hacked p5 valley camera, and applied the radial scale factor and VOILA! A neat little archipalgo designer! Sure it could do with some polishing, but it's pretty fun to experiment with nonetheless!
