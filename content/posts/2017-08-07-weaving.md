Last christmas I was privvy to witness the giving of a gift to a young relative of mine, a weaving kit. Included in the kit, was a round disk, with a number of notches in the sides, and an arbitary amount of different coloured thread. The instructions, being aimed at the 3-5 range, were very easy to follow, and detailed how to make a basic weave. The concept was straight forward. You used one less thread than notches, such that there was always one notch empty, and you took a thread that was two away from the empty notch, and moved it around into the notch. This was then repeated indefintely, or until you ran out of thread.

Performing this slightly mandrolic task, I couldn't help but take pleasure in the underlying maths taking place. By swapping the threads in such a manner, we were essentially behaving like some kind of recursive function, the end product, a woven thread.

I gave in to the temptation, and decided upon some notation!

I figuered that this kind of weave could be defined by, for a given number of threads, a series of twists, whereby a twist is defined as two neighbouring threads switching place, one passing over, and the other under.

I decided that a way to write this down (after several failed attempts) was as such:

- A weave is an array of strings, representing twists.
- A twist is defined by a position integer, followed by a direction character.
- A directional character is either a '+' or a '-'.
- The position integer, defines which thread is passed over in the twist (defined from hereon as the "over-thread").
- The directional character defines which direction the over thread goes.

An example of the afor description, written up in Javascript is then:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
var w = new Weave(4, ["2+", "3-", "1+"]);
{{< / highlight >}}

The first argument to the constructor defines the number of threads, and then the array details the twists.

With a concrete definition I set about visualising some twists.

Not planning on making anything ground breaking, I took to the p5 framework again due to its ease of use. That being said, I didn't write pretty code :/

I did start with something clean. A good constructor. The two things we need to define our weave, the number of strands, and the twists (although I admit, some kind of validation to ensure the arguments were of the expected type would have been nice).

{{< highlight javascript >}}
function Weave(number_of_strands, twists) {
    this.number_of_strands = number_of_strands;
    this.twists = twists;
}
{{< / highlight >}}

Next I decided I needed a draw function. I started with the assumption I would iterate through the defined twists. Starting at the top of the weave, and working my way down. This naturally led to a for loop.

{{< highlight javascript >}}
this.draw = function() {
    for(var t=0;t<this.twists.length;t++) {
        for(var s=0;s<this.number_of_strands;s++){
            // Do something...
        }
    }
}
{{< / highlight >}}

I then realised that if I'm drawing a twist at a time, I need to draw the strands, not in the order left to right, but in the order back to front. I needed to draw the over-thread last. Cue, hacky index based array lookup, and some dubios ternaries..

{{< highlight javascript >}}
var twist_strand = +this.twists[t].substring(0, this.twists[t].length-1);
var twist_direction = this.twists[t].substring(this.twists[t].length-1, this.twists[t].length) === "+";
var twist_swap = twist_strand + (twist_direction ? 1 : -1);
{{< / highlight >}}

Now I knew what each strand was, I could deal with them in the appropriate manner. An if ladder to catch the eventualities presented itself. Remember, I wanted to draw everything aside from the over-thread.

{{< highlight javascript >}}
if (s === twist_strand) continue;
else if (s === twist_strand-1 && twist_direction === false) {
    line(s*w, t*h, (s+1)*w, (t+1)*h);
}
else if (s === twist_strand+1 && twist_direction === true) line(s*w, t*h, (s-1)*w, (t+1)*h)
else line(s*w, t*h, s*w, (t+1)*h);
{{< / highlight >}}

> Note: I also added some constants such as `w` and `h` for width and height here.

Throwing in an array swap at the end of each loop, to save on reallocating:

{{< highlight javascript >}}
var temp = positions[twist_strand];
positions[twist_strand] = positions[twist_swap];
positions[twist_swap] = temp;
{{< / highlight >}}

This gave me something a bit odd, but none the less interesting!

The over-thread was more of the same, but happening after the other threads. 

{{< highlight javascript >}}
if (twist_direction === false) line(twist_strand*w, t*h, (twist_strand-1)*w, (t+1)*h);
else line(twist_strand*w, t*h, (twist_strand+1)*w, (t+1)*h);
{{< / highlight >}}

The issue now was distinguishing between the strands. I needed to track which position each thread in was at each stage now, not just the twists taking place.

I added a bank of colours in the constructor..

{{< highlight javascript >}}
    this.colours = [];
    for(var i=0;i<this.number_of_strands;i++) {
        this.colours.push(color('hsl('+Math.round(i/this.number_of_strands * 255)+', 100%, 50%)'));
    }
{{< / highlight >}}

..along side a lookup before drawing normal strands...

{{< highlight javascript >}}
for(var s=0;s<this.number_of_strands;s++){
    stroke(this.colours[positions[s]]);
    if (s === twist_strand) continue;
    else if (s === twist_strand-1 && twist_direction === false) {
        line(s*w, t*h, (s+1)*w, (t+1)*h);
    }
    else if (s === twist_strand+1 && twist_direction === true) line(s*w, t*h, (s-1)*w, (t+1)*h)
    else line(s*w, t*h, s*w, (t+1)*h);
}
{{< / highlight >}}

.. and finally another lookup for the over-strand.

{{< highlight javascript >}}
stroke(this.colours[positions[twist_strand]]);
if (twist_direction === false) line(twist_strand*w, t*h, (twist_strand-1)*w, (t+1)*h);
else line(twist_strand*w, t*h, (twist_strand+1)*w, (t+1)*h);
{{< / highlight >}}

Putting all this together, gives us quite a neat result :)
